# writelog-automation-demo
This is a C# program, external to WriteLog, that demonstrates both automating WriteLog and monitoring WriteLog.
It makes no attempt to exhaustively cover all WriteLog's automation features, but it does show how to get
started; how to connect to a WriteLog instance in various ways, how to obtain interfaces to WriteLog's various
automation servers and callbacks, and how to call at least one method on each.
